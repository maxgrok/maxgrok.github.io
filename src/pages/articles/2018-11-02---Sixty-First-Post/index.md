In this post, I will be going over useful ruby methods to be familiar with as a beginner. 

These methods include: 
`.each`, `.map`, & `.select` 

Let's get started. 

`.each` is an iterator method in Ruby. It is used to perform a specific action over each member of a hash or an array. 

Here is an example of `.each` in action! 
```
    array = [0,1,2,3]
    def add_one(array)
        return array.each do |el|
          return el + 1
        end
    end

    add_one(array)
    ---> [0,1,2,3]
```

It does not alter the original array. 

For more details, please see these posts: [Ruby Iterators][https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_iterators.htm] 

`.map` is an enumerable method in Ruby. 

Here is an example of `.map` in action: 

```
array =[0,1,2,3]
 def map(array)
    return array.map { |i| i+1 }
 end
map(array)

--> [1,2,3,4]
```

This alters each element of the array and returns a new array with the alterations. 

For more details, see [Enumerables in Ruby][https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Enumerable.html] 

`.select` is an enumerable method in Ruby. 

Here is an example of `.select` in action: 
```
array = [0,1,2,3]
def select(array)
    array.select { |i| i.even? }
    end

select(array)
--> [0,2]

```

`.select` returns a new array with the elements that meet the condition specified. 

For more details, see [Enumerables in Ruby][https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Enumerable.html]

All these methods are used frequently in Ruby. It is good to familiarize oneself with many different uses of them for your own programs!
