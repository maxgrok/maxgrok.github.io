<em>
I just graduated from Consensys Academy Blockchain Developer Bootcamp and am actively searching for funding for my new startup, <a href="http://www.delance.app/">DeLance</a>, and/or a tech position, preferrably Full Stack, Dapp, or Smart Contract Engineering. I'm flexible for awesome teams with meaningful work.

</em><Br/>
<strong>TLDR;</strong> <br/>My trip to ETHCC was made possible by Maple.loans and RocketNFT. I borrowed at the same rate that I borrowed before.  
 </em>

## The Second Loan

I received 750 DAI from Maple.loans at 10% APR for 6 months and another 750 DAI from RocketNFT at the same terms. The collateral is me working for a week for each loan. 

## Connect!

Drop me a line, if you're going to EthCC, say hi, especially if you are interested in funding DeLance or hiring!
