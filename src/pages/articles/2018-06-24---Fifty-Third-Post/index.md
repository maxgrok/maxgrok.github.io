<h2>Node</h2>

According to the Node.js docs, "Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world." <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>

For a boiled down version of what Node is, I found a simpler description. Node "is a JavaScript runtime environment. It is mostly used for Back-End development, but also for general scripting. In the context of Front-End development, it can be used to perform a whole bunch of tasks like linting, testing, and assembling files." (<a href="https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch/blob/master/tutorial/01-node-yarn-package-json.md#readme">Chapter 1 - Node, Yarn, `package.json`</a>)

<h3>What does that mean? What is a runtime environment? What is general scripting? What is linting?</h3> 

Let's break this down. 

A <strong>runtime environment</strong> is an environment that has all the things you need to run a program such as common libraries, directory structure, etc., with no tools to change it (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3710130/what-is-run-time-environment">StackOverflow - What is a runtime environment?</a>). 

<strong>General scripting</strong> is meant to refer to running program commands such as "programs written for a special run-time environment that automate the execution of tasks [1] that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">Scripting Language - Wikipedia</a>).

<strong>Linting</strong> is the process of reviewing a file and checking for errors such as syntax errors (i.e. a missing semicolon in your JS). 

Synthesis: Node is where Javascript can be run with all the libraries and environment variables that you need to execute general commands such as `node -v` or later to run a simple JS web app `node .` in your CLI. 

On to the next tool, yarn. 

<h2>Yarn</h2>

Yarn is 'fast, reliable, and secure dependency management'(<a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/">Yarn Docs</a>). In other words, yarn is a 'package manager for your code' (<a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/">Yarn Docs</a>).

<h2>`package.json`</h2>

<h2>Babel</h2>
  transpiling JSX into JS so the browser can read it. 

<h2>ES6</h2>

<h2>ESh2nt</h2>

<h2>Flow</h2>

<h2>Jest</h2>
  Testing framework for React apps. 

<h2>Webpack</h2>

<h2>React</h2>

<h2>HMR</h2>
