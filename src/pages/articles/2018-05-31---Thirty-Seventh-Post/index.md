<h2>The Start of It All</h2>
I started out with an idea -- build maps of all the resources nearby me so that I don't starve. Why would I starve? I was recently shunned by my family of origin for being who I am. At the time of the idea, I was in NYC, a queer-friendly haven, living in a church basement, with nothing but my backpack, it's contents, and faith in the kindness of strangers (read: I knew only a few people there, but they weren't willing to take me in.) Bottom line: I needed to know where food was served so I could eat. I needed to know where healthcare was so that I could be seen. I needed to know where the Department of Human Services was so that I could apply for benefits. I needed all the help I could get. 

Having studied International Social Entrepreneurship at University of Rochester, I reflected back to one of my favorite classes, Social Networking Theory and Entrepreneurship. In it, I was exposed to social networking theory of the strength of weak ties (granoveter) and the idea of creative destruction(schumpeter). So, I devised a plan. I'd map out all the out of date paper resources and organize the information in a more accessible, actionable way into a digital format so that I and my friends would never starve, die of a minor infection, or not have a place to stay. I envisioned a future where that was all possible due to access to actionable information. I wanted to put the power in our hands as consumers of social services, rather than delegate away that power to case workers who did not know us as well as we knew ourselves and were often overworked.  

I started out with trying to learn how to program and cobbling together something with the BatchGeo API online. I would show you a picture, but the maps have currently expired. However, this allowed me to get the name, address, phone number, and website of different resources to be on a map and be searchable. Therefore, even if I lost the paper packet of resources, I could refer to the digital version and not be depending on case worker appointments to regain all the resources information (some of which was out of date or locations were closed). I couldn't learn how to program fast enough. I didn't have much money, so I relied on free resources such as Learn Ruby the Hard Way and initial offerings of Treehouse and Codecademy, but nothing really connected me from A to Z with what I wanted to build. I discovered Flatiron School, but knew I didn't have teh money to attend and by the time I found out about their program partnership with the State of NY, it was too late to apply and the program was closed. 

I attended tech events in NYC and tried to get more knowledge about the industry and set my sights on becoming a coder. In the intermediate, I traveled the country in search of affordable housing for trans folks and found sparse opportunities with years of waitlists for even the most well-known rapid-housing programs in the country. I came up with sparse opportunities and strangers who took me in on a whim and showered me with kindness and to whom I am forever grateful.  

After a lot of hard work and luck, I'd managed to survive non-violently for many years. 

<h2>A Stroke of Luck: DC Launches Flatiron School Campus</h2>
For various reasons, I ended up in Baltimore and kept studying programming throughout my travels. After many months of studying online through the community-powered Flatiron School bootcamp (which opened years later) as one of the founding members, I saw that Flatiron School was opening a campus in DC, near enough to where I was living in Baltimore at the time. It was close enough that I could commute. I could really benefit from the in-person community because I was rather stuck in the online curriculum. 

So, I decided to take the plunge and apply to the in-person bootcamp. The only problem was that I didn't have the money to drop on an in-person bootcamp and felt bad applying without having the money. I've lived on half the federal poverty line pretty much my entire life with only access to education, the basics, and a firm belief in karma. I've been able to get by (sometimes on less than $1 a day), but by no means have access to $15,000 for an in-person program. 

However, I had reached a point in my startup journey where I needed education and access to knowledge that would take years and years to cobble together on my own. I needed that basic knowledge now, not years and years later. 

<h2>Taking the Plunge: The Application</h2>
I decided to write Flatiron School and apply. Their question for the application essay pleasantly surprised me. It may have been updated, but here is my question and here is what my answer was. 

Question: Tell us about yourself! What makes you unique? What are you up to now and how did you end up there?

Answer: I'm a queer non-binary Jewish trans man who has survived housing instability for 10 years on and off across the world. The short story is that my family of origin rejected me for being trans and I fled to NYC. I've lived on less than a dollar a day before and not as an experiment. I made GIS maps online using BatchGeo to prevent myself from going hungry, access resources, and generally map out the systems I was engaging in. Soon, I realized I needed more help and training to figure out how to build and design web applications that were customizeable, as I couldn't afford a pro version of BatchGeo. I started learning immediately via Team Treehouse, Learn Ruby the Hard Way, and reading blogs of other people's journeys like Jeffrey Baird, but it was hard to pin point exactly what I needed to get from A-Z. No one was there in person to share the story, be supportive, and generally egg me on. I had to do it myself, but my heart was set.

First thing is first, I'm obsessed with finding solutions to the problems I encountered when I was outside such as lack of actionable information, which is why I started Gryd (www.grydit.com) as soon as I built my first map. It aims to make the free and low-cost resources available to communities more transparent, accessible, and reviewable. You can search for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. You can search for places to sleep. It's unloseable, unlike traditional paper resource packets, and more up to date. However, by the time I got very small amount of funding for the minimum viable product, I didn't have the skills and ended up managing a team of remote developers via UpWork and other freelancer sites. So, I wrote technical specs for what I needed as best I could and designed through what I had learned on a free Coursera Human-Computer Interaction course, iteratively, low-fidelity prototypes were my way of communicating what I needed. It still wasn't getting much adoption, even though Aunt Bertha, my main competitor, has now raised $6M in a series B. At the time that I was building Gryd maps with BatchGeo, Aunt Bertha's founder was going through a TED Fellowship and had received a fair amount of attention and funding. I didn't know where to start and was intimidated by the process and prestige. Who would believe that a street kid had a good idea? Who would trust me with $1M? I grew shy at the thought of telling my story and was experiencing imposter syndrome in startup land. I couldn't see anyone who looked like me, had my experiences, building cool tech startups. So, I decided to become that person.

Right now, I'm co-founder of HostHome, one of the only trans-led tech startups in the world with my co-founder, Ava Pipitone, leader of the Baltimore Transgender Alliance. If Airbnb and OkCupid had a baby that aimed at housing vulnerable populations, that would be HostHome. It's a sliding scale fee for guests, hosts are paid market Airbnb rate for their hosting, and donors contribute to our non-profit arm to make up the difference. Guests and hosts are matched by life and roommate compatibility same day as guests request a stay. In our pilot last year, we hosted 20+ people, 75+ nights, had 4 hosts, and used only $1200 and an accessible 1-800 number. Since then, we've been accepted into the Hopkins Social Innovation Lab's 2017-2018 cohort, been covered in numerous local press publications such as Technical.ly DC and Hopkins Hub. We've raised around $6000 for our efforts through the Social Innovation Lab, YouCaring Campaign, and National Science Foundation I-Corp program.

With the help of the Flatiron School, I'll become a full-stack developer. I'll become the technical talent that I need to build solutions for these problems. I'll be able to become that person that I didn't see around and blaze a trail for others like me.

<h2>The Interview Process</h2> 

As for the process after the application was submitted, I had a invitation to the soft, cultural interview with Annette from Flatiron School who was very kind. I was then directed to do the Flatiron School prep bootcamp, which I had already completed because of an early free offering they made sometime ago when they were testing it out as curriculum. 

After this, I got an invitation to have a technical interview with Niky who later became one of my instructors as a member of the first DC cohort ever! 

As for the scholarship, they made it super easy so that I didn't have to fill in another application for it. I was able to use what I had submitted as my scholarship application. 

<h2>The Scholarship Miracle</h2>

At first, they worked a miracle. I didn't have to fill out another essay. I simply asked Annette about the scholarship and she was took care of it. She was able to secure 1/2 tuition scholarship for me, which was incredible. 

However, I still needed $2000 yesterday to secure my spot and another $5500 to pay for the rest of tuition. 

<h2>The Hustle: A Fundraising Web App</h2>
In order to hustle up the other half and the $2000 for deposit, I worked with them on copywriting and built a website that expressed what I was trying to do and why I wanted to do it. 

At the time, I was also headed to SF to attend the Fast Forward conference on a friend of mine's generous dime and faith in me for the startup I was working on then, HostHome. My plan was to hustle up another $7,500 from people I had never met before at the conference. I was going to use my website to make a difference. 

I wrote the web app, which is still up as of right now --- www.helpmax.club

I purchased for about $12 for a year of domain space, which was close to the last of my money to be honest, but I was betting on my future. People I was going to hustle needed a quick, easy URL to access, not an obscure Heroku address. I used netlify to deploy it, wrote it in rails, organized it in the front-end with a template used for API documentation, and launched it with different modes of giving included. All in all, I made it as quickly as I could. 

I was at the conference, struggling to build the confidence to go speak to people about my scholarship, then something amazing happened. I got a phone call from an unknown number in NY. I usually don't answer unknown numbers, but I had a feeling it was worth answering. So, I picked it up. It was Katy ( I believe!) from Flatiron School. She said that there was no need for me to hustle up the other half of the money. They had pulled together another scholarship for me to attend from Out in Tech, an LGBT organization that supports LGBT people in tech! 

<strong>Suddenly, I was in.</strong> I would start the week after that week in the 1st ever cohort in their DC campus and I couldn't have been more thrilled! 


<h2>Flatiron School: Miracle Workers</h2>
Flatiron School seriously worked and is working miracles to make my education a reality. They continue to inspire me to move forward to learn to code. As someone who was literally told they would be no good at math or tech because they were a woman, I am whole-heartedly happy to have found a place in tech where I belong, a place that believes in and invests in materially supporting me as a whole person.

<strong>Overall, I'm in the best place I could possibly be for learning coding.</strong> It's a very kind, accepting, encouraging, curious, proactive culture of learning. The process of learning here does just the right amount of coddling and challenging. We do check-ins everyday concerning our learning process, specifically if we are in panic mode, learning mode, or comfort zone, with the option to give comments. We get feedback in a very direct, kind way on our coding and process of coding. 

Now, I'm reflecting on the amazing gift that I have been given. Flatiron School is teaching me how to fish, rather than just giving me fish. I sincerely believe in them, just as they believe in me. It's a wonderful joy to see them expand, as there are many more of people like me who need an education in tech in order to succeed. 

<h2>A Message to Other Trans Folks</h2>

There is a place in tech for you. There are people who value your opinion and want to see you succeed. There are techies who believe in you, diversity, and inclusion. It's not a rouse. It's a reality. 

If you want to apply to Flatiron School, especially in DC, please let me know. I can talk to you about my experience and introduce you to the wonderful Flatiron School DC community. 

<h2>Thank You</h2>
This post and story could not have happened without the help of the Flatiron School and Out in Tech. Thank you for your kindness and generosity. 

May I make you proud in the years to come.
