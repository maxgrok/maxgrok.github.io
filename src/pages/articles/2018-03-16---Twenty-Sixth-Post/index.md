It is my pleasure to announce that I was elected in March during our annual member meeting to be the President of the Baltimore Node. The Baltimore Node officer team for March 2018 to March 2019 consists of Eileen McMahon as Vice President, Joel Wheatley as Treasurer, and Phil Edwards as Secretary.

After my experience as Vice President last year, I decided to run for President in order to help grow the Node to include more diversity, as well as introduce and produce new events such as hackathons, tech talks, etc. It's my deep honor to continue to be a part of a team that values diversity and inclusion.

During this upcoming year, I look forward to having tech talks, improving the space and equipment, and reaching out to more communities to invite them into our classes, events, and hearts.

If you have any questions about the hackerspace, please feel free to reach out to me <a href="mailto:max.a.goodman@gmail.com">max.a.goodman@gmail.com</a>!
