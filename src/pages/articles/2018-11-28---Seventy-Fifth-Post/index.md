Housing problem - Many cities are plagued with them. Homelessness is rampant. The wealth divide grows in the US making it harder and harder to keep the basics under control for the average American. 

Technological solutions to these problems involve not a reinventing of the system of housing and real-estate, a radical reimagining of sharing space, rather they consist of using the same space in moderately radical ways. 

For example, Airbnb is popular as a housing option among those who posess online reputation and are largely white. Alternatives such as noirbnb.com have popped up to conquer this racial inequality of access to such systems. However, they are still rife with accessibility issues. Couchsurfing.org provides a free alternative and pre-dates the two services by providing cultural exchange in exchange for housing and hospitality. However, this service has become more corporate and less peer driven over the years. 
Overall, nothing has radically reimagined what housing solutions could actually look like if we were to no longer be isolating poor communities through programs such as shelters and transitional living programs and section 8 housing. 

These options provide a stop-gap for a larger problem: community and literal shelter. However, they are more like playing hot potato from a user perspective; one must use one, then another, then a different one; burning through networks while barely scraping by. 

There is an alternative solution: a radical reimagining of housing options. 

If we can now deploy a loan agreement via blockchain with a few minutes and no centralized authority, then we should be able to write an agreement between ad-hoc peer landlords and peer rentees that re-writes ownership over the long term. As one rents, one gains ownership in the real-estate and effectively incentives to maintain the value of the property. 

Going one step further, we could combine these sorts of smart contract deployments with an Airbnb-esque model where the agreements are no longer governed by year or month, but by a flexible period of time determined by each party and executed by smart contract. 

We could reimagine what hosting someone looks like with explicit expectations and agreements written to the knowledge and participation of both parties. 

We could make a three party agreement system whereby one party pays for the housing, one party is housed, and another party is paid to provide the space. All executed by smart contract. Followed up with reviews for all parties involved.
