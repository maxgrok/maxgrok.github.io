This week has been a windstorm of learning.

"A page of formulas just looks so impressive. (Tip: for extra impressiveness, use Greek variables.) And so there is a great temptation to work on problems you can treat formally, rather than problems that are, say, important." - Paul Graham, <em>Hackers and Painters</em>

"The place to fight design wars is in new markets, where no one has yet managed to establish any fortifications." - Paul Graham, Y Combinator

"hackers are makers" - Paul Graham

"You're better off if you admit this up front, and write programs in a way that allows specifications to change on the fly." - Paul Graham

"Relentlessness wins because, in the aggregate, unseen details become visible." -- Paul Graham, Painters and Hackers

"Like painting, most software is intended for a human audience. And so hackers, like painters, must have empathy to do really great work. You have to be able to see things from the user's point of view." - Paul Graham, Painters and Hackers

The unexotic underclass -- MIT
