I'm building a peer-to-peer crowdfunding platform from scratch. 

In module 2, we covered CRUD with validations in Rails, as well as associations, authentication, forms, and other rails helpers. 

What's working: 

Categories: Update, Read, Delete, Create

What's not working: 

- Pledges create, update, delete
- Projects create, update, delete
