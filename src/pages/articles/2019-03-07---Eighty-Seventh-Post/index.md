Recently, I was building a yelp clone and deploying it to Heroku. I was using Ruby 2.6.0 and Rails 6 to build the application and came across some difficulties. 

Some errors you may get while deploying to Heroku using my dependencies and the `rails new` command. 

(1) Heroku does not support sqlite3 

Fix this with the right db/config file for postgresql and removing 'sqlite3' from your Gemfile and adding 'gem 'pg'' to your Gemfile. 

Replace your current config file with the following for example: 

```ruby
development:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: my_database_development
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000
test:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: my_database_test
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000

production:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: my_database_production
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000
```

(2) Bundler 2 is required for Heroku to run the build. 

Fix: Upgrade Ruby version from 2.6.0 => 2.6.1
 This is done to fix the Bundler 2 install error from Heroku on attempting git push heroku master. 

(3) For any resource that does not exist error for your database in your heroku logs --tail 

Fix: run `heroku run rake db:migrate`. 

Congratulations! Your app is now deployed to Heroku!
