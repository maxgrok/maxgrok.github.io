## Install Geth (for Mac OS X)

Run the following commands: 
`brew tap ethereum/ethereum`
`brew install ethereum`

Run this command to start geth on the rinkeby network:
`geth --rinkeby --syncmode fast console`

You should see something like the following: 
!["geth rinkeby result"](./geth_rinkeby_result.png)
