As soon as Flatiron School announced they were opening a school in DC, I applied. After a technical and cultural interview, it is my pleasure to announce that I have been accepted into the first ever DC cohort for the Flatiron School. I am extremely lucky and looking forward to learning as much as I can over the next few months and forging strong friendships along the way.

For those looking to apply, be authentic, work hard, and (hint, hint) be a reasonable person. If you have any specific questions about Flatiron School, feel free to email me here: <a href="mailto:max.a.goodman@gmail.com">max.a.goodman@gmail.com</a>.
