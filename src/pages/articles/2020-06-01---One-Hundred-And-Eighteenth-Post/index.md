I just completed the course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/learning-to-learn-efficient-learning-zero-to-mastery/learn/lecture/17817730?start=0#overview">"Learning How to Learn" </a>with Andrei on Udemy. It was the best $11.99 I've ever spent. I will use the techniques for the rest of my life on my journey and am infinitely grateful for this course. 

As someone who wants to learn a lot of different skills, I find the advice given in the course regarding learning techniques to be priceless. Now, I have strategies to tackle any skill and tackle learning it without burning out and store it in my long-term memory! 

Today, I'm going to share some of those techniques with you and explain them because that helps solidify my learning and is a joy to share. 

If you're like me, then you can focus on a subject for hours and hours and hours and walk away with a short term knowledge, but not a long term understanding of what you've just studied. Enter the Pomodoro technique.

The Pomodoro Technique limits one's sessions of learning to 25 minutes on and 5 minutes off. This allows you to switch between being extremely focused and extremely relaxed, which is very good for the brain. 

While learning it is not only necessary to limit and have an end to the learning while being super focused, it is also important to interleave different techniques into your learning. The interleaving technique is the process of mixing up different techniques for your learning one subject to make sure it sticks. 

For example, I'm currently using the Feynman technique by explaining other learning techniques to you, but I would also potentially explain them outloud to another person and teach them to interleave my learning of learning how to learn! 

So, this leads us to the third technique: the Feynman technique. The Feynman technique is the act of explaining your learning and what you learned to someone else in the simplest way possible so that non-experts can grok it. Either by writing it down and explaining it back to yourself by recall or teaching it actively to someone else in the moment. 

These are only a few of the techniques that I learned while taking the Learning How to Learn course. I highly recommend it, especially for software engineers who are often called on to learn frequently, if not all the time.  

Happy learning!
