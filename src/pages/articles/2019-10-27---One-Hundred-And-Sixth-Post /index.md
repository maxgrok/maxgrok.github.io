In case anyone else has this issue, I decided to write this post about the `Sharp` package error install using npm with Gatsby. 

I was updating my blog and realized that I'd set NVM to a new Node version (v.12.12.0) and hadn't installed Gatsby command line tools when trying to run 'gatsby build' to test out a new post before deploying.  

Upon installing Gatsby CLI using `npm install -g gatbsy-cli` for the latest version, I discovered an error with installing `Sharp` package when running `npm install` within my blog directory. 

Here is the error I got: 
```js
gyp ERR! build error

```

Here is the link to the issue on <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/11026"> Github</a>.

I read one of the solutions was to run `npm upgrade` and it worked. It upgraded the version of `Sharp` to `0.23.1` to work well with the newest version of Gatsby. It also updated a bunch of other packages as well. 

Hopefully, this solves your issue!
