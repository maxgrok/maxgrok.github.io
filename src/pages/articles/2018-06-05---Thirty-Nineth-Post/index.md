<p>In order to tell you about the Yelp! clone I built, I'll answer a few questions.</p>

<h3>Did you design/build the front end of your app? What technologies did you use?</h3><br>

<p>I used HTML, CSS, Ruby, Rails, postgres, and ES6 JS async.</p>

<h3>Did you write all the API functionality using Ruby on Rails and the MVC pattern?</h3><br><p>I wrote the API functionality using an MVC pattern in Rails 5.</p>

<h3>Did you design the DB logic and schema? Did you use ActiveRecord and SQLite? Postgres?</h3><p>In this Yelp! clone API, I used postgres as a database because it's compatible with Heroku.</p>

<h3>Did you make use of interesting/complex Gems?</h3>

<p>I used the following gems in Rails: Faker, Active Model Serializer, rack-cors. <br>
Faker generates fake seed data for use to test out relationships and make lorem ipsum type data for the application.</p> 
<p>Active Model Serializer allows one's application to generate JSON in an 'object-oriented and convention-driven manner' <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/active_model_serializers/versions/0.10.7">active-model-serializer@Rubygems></a></p>
<p>rack-cors gem provides "Middleware that will make Rack-based apps CORS compatible."<a href="https://frontendian.co/cors">CORS information</a>,<a href="https://github.com/cyu/rack-cors">rack-cors</a>,<a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/rack-cors">rack-cors-info</a></p>

<h3>What challenges did you face?</h3>
<p>I am currently learning how to integrate the JS <a href="https://thejsguy.com/2015/10/16/the-adapter-pattern-in-javascript.html">adapter pattern</a> into refactored code.</p>
