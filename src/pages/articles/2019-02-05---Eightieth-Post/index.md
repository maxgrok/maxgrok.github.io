In this post, we will discover go over the HTTP protocol, IPFS, and the potential future of the entire web. Let's start with where we are now. 

##Current Web and the HTTP Protocol

>"HTTP is the protocol that web browsers and web servers use to communicate with each other over the Internet. It is an application level protocol because it sits on top of the TCP layer in the protocol stack and is used by specific applications to talk to one another. In this case the applications are web browsers and web servers."

##The Potential Future: IPFS and the Permanent Web

## Install and Use IPFS

On a Mac OS X, use the following commands. [More install instructions here][https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/install/]

```
tar xvfz go-ipfs.tar.gz
$ cd go-ipfs
$ ./install.sh
```

Test out IPFS by running `ipfs help` in your command line. If you get an output similar to this: 
```
USAGE: 

ipfs - Global p2p merkle-dag filesystem.
...
```

The installation worked! 

##Conclusion

The future of the web is a decentralized peer-to-peer network that stores all the files in a distributed nature. Now, you know how to use the basics of IPFS and can get started using the new decentralized, p2p protocol that may well govern the future of the web.
